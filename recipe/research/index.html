            <h2> Recipe Websites </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NY Times Cooking</a> has a really nice landing page that immediately draws you in with a new recipe of the day. The type is really sophisticated yet easy to read, and the fact that they have the ingredients and directions side by side on the recipe pages is a life-saver.. No more endlessly scrolling back and forth while you're cooking!
                </li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">Serious Eats</a> is interesting because each recipe has a "Why is Works" section explaining the food science behind the culinary choices. The icons in the recipe factd are nice to look at and I like how you can add ingredients to a shopping list at the click of a button.
                </li>
